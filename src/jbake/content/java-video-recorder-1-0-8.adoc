Well, it took some time to make video recorder stable. I've added a couple useful features since version 1.0.1.

So let's make it clear and answer the question "What kind of problems does it solve?".

The main idea was to create a library that provides an easy way to record video during test execution. It doesn't matter what java test runner you use, it supports JUnit, TestNG and Spock.

Let's look at some real cases. For example you have a lot of automated test scenarios in your project, but some test scripts are flaky.

So you have two options:

First is to delete them from test execution because you have already spend a huge amount of time to debug them.

Second one is to add Video recorder, catch all the problems, fix them and be happy.

Moreover, to add video recording support in your existing test automations framework require three simple steps:

**1.Add project dependency**

[source, xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.automation-remarks</groupId>
    <artifactId>video-recorder-junit</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.8</version>
</dependency>
----

**2.Add JUnit rule to you test class**

[source, java]
----
import com.automation.remarks.video.junit.VideoRule;
import org.junit.Rule;

public class JUnitVideoTest {

    @Rule
    public VideoRule videoRule = new VideoRule();

}
----

**3.Add test and mark it with **@Video** annotation:**

[source, java]
----
import com.automation.remarks.video.annotations.Video;
import com.automation.remarks.video.junit.VideoRule;
import org.junit.Rule;
import org.junit.Test;

import static junit.framework.Assert.assertTrue;

public class JUnitVideoTest {

    @Rule
    public VideoRule videoRule = new VideoRule();

    @Test
    @Video
    public void shouldFailAndCreateRecordWithTestName() {
        // test code
    }
----

That's all! Now if your test fails, video will be recordered automatically.

The same scenario can be done for TestNG, please refer to https://sergeypirogov.github.io/video-recorder-java/[documetation]

Isn't it cool?

But hold on, it has even more features such as configurations and @Video annotation parameters.

**@Video** annotation takes two optional parameters. By setting values to them you can override video file name or disable video recording for one particular test.

Video configuration example:

[source, java]
----
VideoRecorder.conf()
                .withVideoFolder("custom_folder")
                .videoEnabled(true)
                .withVideoSaveMode(VideoSaveMode.ALL)
                .withRecordMode(RecordingMode.ANNOTATED);
----

As you can see it allows to override default parameters.

All this parameters can be passed by command line, for example if you are executing you test in CI server.

Example:

[source, java]
----
mvn test -Dvideo.folder="custom_folder"
         -Dvideo.enabled=true
         -Dvideo.mode=ANNOTATED
         -Dvideo.save.mode=ALL
----

**Important point: FOR NOW SETTINGS PASSED IN CODE HAVE HIGHER PRIORITY AND CAN'T BE OVERRIDDEN BY COMMAND LINE PARAMETERS.**

I hope this library will make life of test automation engineers easier and will help to detect fix flaky tests.
